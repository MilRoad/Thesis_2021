"Optimization of vehicle routing for waste collection and transportation"

Annotation
============
This thesis considers the problem of optimal collection and removal of municipal solid waste. In order to solve it, the following metaheuristics were proposed: ant colony optimization and genetic algorithms. These algorithms were modified and applied to solve the problem of routing vehicles with limited capacities for collecting MSW. The analysis of the implemented algorithms and their comparative characteristics with the ready-made OR-Tools algorithm are presented.
A software implementation is proposed in Python 3 programming language using Jupyter Notebook.
